      As runners, we all know that the key to better running is to do a lot of running. All the research points to running volume as the major       indicator of being a successful runner. But, as runners, we also know that it can be hard to motivate ourselves to get out the door             each day and complete that run. David and Megan Roche, a married couple and successful runners themselves, have a coaching business, SWAP         (Some Work, All Play), that focuses on teaching runners how to love the process of running by becoming happy runners. They have recently       written up their coaching philosophy in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2PlDS2d"><cite>The Happy Runner</cite></a>, published this year by Human Kinetics.

     The book is written in two parts. The first part focuses on the mental aspects of being a happy runner. According to the Roches, there are      several rules to being happy as a runner. The first rule, and the most important rule, is that you need to love the process. Being a good      runner involves, as was mentioned earlier, doing a lot of running, day after day after day (though with maybe a least an off day a week). If      you are not in love with this process you are not going to do it consistently and that's going to make you more prone to injury. Included in      this rule is the advice of not chasing results. In other words, if you are running only for the goal of winning your next race, you are not      embracing the process and you're going to be at risk of quitting if you can't consistently meet your winning expectations. Plus, as the 
     Roches point out, not all of us are born with the natural talent necessary to consistently win races. I am definitely in that situation.
