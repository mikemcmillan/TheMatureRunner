        <h2>Race Recovery</h2>
        <p>
        I recently finished a 50-mile race and, since it's my first race at this distance, I was at a loss
        as to how much I should recover. Of course, I know that I need to get plenty of sleep, eat
        nutritiously, and all that, but I don't know how much time I should take off from running before 
        I start back. I decided to first go back and review my racing and recovery history.
        </p>
        <h3>My Recent Recovery Experience</h3>
        <p>
        I have only for the past year begun to race on a regular basis. Before last year, I usually ran
        exactly one half marathon a year. I would be sore for a day or two but after that I would resume
        my regular running schedule. I started last year racing a bit more frequently and by the end of the
        year, I was racing almost monthly. Here are the races I ran and the recovery times I took during 
        that time.
        <ul>
          <li>February, 2018: White Rock 50K - 3 days recovery</li>
          <li>March, 2018: Little Rock Marathon - 1 day recovery but ran as training run</li>
          <li>November, 2018: Sweet Spot 50K - 3 days recovery</li>
          <li>December, 2018: LOViT Trail Marathon - 1 day recovery</li>
          <li>January, 2019: Athens-Big Fork Trail Marathon = 4 days recovery</li>
          <li>March, 2019: Little Rock Marathon - 1 day recovery</li>
          <li>April, 2019: Ouachita Trail 50 Miler - 4 days recovery</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The most common denominator in these recovery times is that the races with the most elevation 
        required the most recovery days. That tells me I need to work on my leg strength but that's the 
        subject of a different article. It also tells me that there was enough elevation in this last race
        that I'm probably going to need at least four days off and maybe more.
        </p>
        <h3>Conventional Wisdom</h3>
        <p>
        One of the most widespread recovery myths that exists is that you should take a day of recovery for 
        every mile of a race. As Ian Torrence says in this&nbsp; 
         <a href="https://www.irunfar.com/2015/04/post-ultra-downtime-how-much-is-enough.html">article</a>         at <a href="https://irunfar.com"> irunfar.com</a>, for someone like myself, who just finished a 
        50 mile race, that's almost two months of recovery time, and there's no way I could take that much
        time off.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here's another recovery      
        <a href="https://www.active.com/triathlon/articles/determining-your-race-recovery-time-4127">   
        &nbsp;article</a>, written by Gale Bernhardt at <a href="https://www.active.com">active.com</a>, that suggests that runners should take off four 
        to six days for each hour of racing. Again, for me, this means that since it took me twelve and half 
        hours to finish the OT50, I need to take off almost two months to recover. Based on my history of 
        recovery from previous races, that is just too long to be off running, and rather than recover from 
        the race I'm just going to end up losing fitness.
        </p>
        <p>A far more doable conventional recovery plan advocated by Brad Stulberg in 
        <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/health-injuries/g20808112/how-to-recover-from-a-race/">                 Runner's World</a> is to participate in a little light active recovery activity after a hard race 
        and avoid hard workouts until the second to third week after the race.
        </p>
         <h3>Keys to Successful Race Recovery</h3>
         <p>The first thing to remember when reading articles about recovery is that we are all experiments 
         of one. What works for me will probably not work exactly the same way for you, due to our unique
         background and experiences as runners. For example, I am not particularly injury-prone, so I don't 
         need as many days of recovery as a more injury-prone person will need. You have to discover what is
         the right recovery period for you through trial and error. You also need to follow the typical
         nutrition and sleep advice most coaches give: try to eat healthy, nutrient dense food during your 
         recovery and get as much sleep as your body needs and your life allows.
