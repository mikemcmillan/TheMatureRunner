        <h2>The Mature Runner</h2>
        <p>This web site is for runners who want to reach the mature stage of their running careers. 
           What does it mean to be a "mature" runner? One definition of mature is "fully developed     
           physically." It's certainly important for runners to strive for that. Another definition of   
           mature is "having reached the most advanced stage in a process." We want you to become the most   
           advanced runner you can be or that you want to be.</p>
        <p>
        I will use the web site to tell my running stories and to also provide my perspective on things 
        like training techniques, write reviews of the running books I read and the running products I use, 
        and provide links to other running articles I think you may be interested in. We will write about 
        all types of running, from road running to trail running to track running. The focus will be on
        "mature" runners, but any runner will find information here that is useful to their training and
        racing.
        </p>

        If there are topics you'd like me to write about, please drop me a line. My email address is 
        mmmcmillan1@att.net. I love hearing from readers. I would also love to share your running stories
        with my readers and will always have a place on the site for them. 
        </p>
        <p>All running is good running!</p>
