        <h2>About The Mature Runner</h2>
<p>
This web site is for runners who want to reach the mature stage of their running careers. What does it mean to be a "mature" runner? One definition of mature is "fully developed physically." It's certainly important for runners to strive for that. Another definition of mature is "having reached the most advanced stage in a process." We want you to become the most advanced runner you can be or that you want to be.
</p>
<p>
We also want to provide help for "mature" runners in the sense of runners who have reached a mature age (over fifty). Many of the articles, training plans, etc. that you read in running magazines and web sites are written in an age-neutral way but are clearly written for younger runners, certainly runners under fifty years of age or so. The Mature Runner wants to help older runners translate these plans and techniques into something they can use without wearing themselves out. It may make sense for a thirty-five-year old runner to train for a marathon on forty miles or more a week, but a mature runner may end up getting injured on such a plan. We want to provide mature runners with plans that will work better for them. 
</p>
<p>
We will provide this help by constantly searching the running literature for research on training techniques for masters (another word for mature) runners, as well as providing insights from mature runners around the world. We will review products and books, looking for insights that can help all runners but especially mature runners. We will link to other content that we think you'll find useful for your running. We'll also provide stories from mature runners on their running journey and how they handle training and racing. If you have a story you'd like to tell, please contact us. While I prefer marathon and ultrarunning distances, we'll also talk about training for shorter distances. All running is good running.

<h2>About Me</h2>

<img src={MMM_pic} alt="Mike McMillan pic" height="300" width="200" />
My name is Mike McMillan, I live in North Little Rock, Arkansas, and I'm a mid-pack runner. I am 61 years old and have been running, mostly recreationally, since 1970. Before that, I was always one of the "slow" kids in sports, but during a football practice in 1970 when the team had to run a mile on the Henderson Junior High dirt single-path track, I managed to outlast most of the team and was among the first finishers. One of the football coaches, Nick Williams, who was also the cross-country coach, grabbed me by the t-shirt and told me I was on the cross-country team. I ran cross-country off and on throughout the rest of school but mostly gave it up for the first few years of college. After gaining a freshman twenty or so pounds, I decided to start running again and by the end of college I was running 20-25 miles per week. 
</p>
<p>
I continued to run recreationally for many years as my wife and I started and raised a family, but my running was wildly inconsistent, sometimes getting in 20 or so miles a week and some weeks 0 miles. My longest runs at this time were five or six miles and I never tried racing. Sometime around 1992 or so I decided to get a little more serious about running and decided to train for a marathon. My first training season ended in injury as did my next two attempts. Finally, on my fourth attempt I made it all the way through a marathon training plan and completed the 1996 First Tennessee Marathon (now the St. Jude's Marathon) in Memphis, Tennessee, finishing in 3:42. 
</p>
<p>
After that, my running went back to 15-25 miles per week with no real racing except an occasional 5K or 10K. Around 2008 or so, I decided to get more serious about my training, and started entering the Little Rock Half Marathon every year, with my training getting up to 30 miles right before the race. 
</p>
<p>
In 2016, I decided my running was in a rut and I needed to do something to shake it up. I decided for a reason I've already forgotten that I would run the Pikes Peak Marathon in 2017 for my 60th birthday, which is always held the third week in August, a week after my birthday. I began increasing my mileage, slowly, from 25 miles per week to 40 miles or so, peaking at 45 miles right before Pikes Peak. I ran the 2017 Little Rock Marathon in 4:11 to qualify for Pikes Peak. My wife and I went to Manitou Springs in August and I completed the marathon in 9:07, not a great time but not bad for a 60-year old flatlander. 
</p>
<p>
Since then I have devoted my running to longer distances. I have completed two 50K races, two trail marathons, the Little Rock marathon twice more, and next week (April 13, 2019) I am running my first 50-miler, the Ouachita Trail 50 Miler. My long-range plan is to complete an 100K race next year and a 100 mile race the year after that. I also want to do some adventure running, but my wife and I are still negotiating that path.
</p>
<p>
During this new phase of my running, I have read just about every running book there is (well, it feels like it anyway) and looked at hundreds of training plans. The key thing I have learned is that to finish long races in decent times you need to spend some time running fast, even if its just short 2-minute repeats. I&#39;ll be talking about this a lot in my blog. I will also talk a lot about running consistency, as I feel this is the reason that as a mature runner I can run 6 days a week and up to 60 miles a week without much more than an occasional sore tendon. 
</p>
<p>
Running is an important part of my life but it's not my whole life. I have been married for almost 39 years now to Terri, who is a Registered Nurse at Arkansas Children's Hospital. I work full-time at UA&#8211;Pulaski Technical College where I teach computer science. I have three children&#58; Meredith, an English instructor at Pulaski Tech, Allison, a first-grade teacher at Crystal Hill Elementary in Maumelle, AR, and Mason, who is a banker in Chicago, IL. I am proud to say that all three of my children do some running and I have run with and against them in several races. When I'm not teaching or running, I enjoy traveling and as I write this, my wife and I are planning a trip to London and Cornwall England in late spring 2019.
